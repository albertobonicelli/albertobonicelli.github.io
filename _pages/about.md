I am currently a visiting student at the Laboratoire de probabilités, statistique et modélisation, Sorbonne University, under the supervision of [Prof. Lorenzo Zambotti](https://www.lpsm.paris/users/zambotti/index). 

I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Pavia, obtaining a BSc and an MSc in Physics summa cum laude.
